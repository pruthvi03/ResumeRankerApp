# ResumeRankerApp

The resume screening process is certainly a time consuming as well as an important aspect of recruiting candidates. The way this process is accomplished directly affects the quality of staff hired by the organization. 
As an advancement to the conventional process, we aim to develop an automated resume parsing cum ranking application. Using our application, the companies can register themselves specifying the skills needed for various available positions. The candidates have to just upload their resume and their details would be extracted from the resume itself which will automate the candidate registration. The proposed system will implement a candidate ranking based on the priority of different resume parameters. To further improve the selection criteria, an aptitude cum personality test would be conducted whose result would be displayed in a graphical format along with the marks. 
Hence the daunting task of selecting the “right candidate for the right post” would become much easy.

This is an android app, for our Gujarat Hackathon project(2020). It includes company/candidate profile, home page, search job page, edit profile. It also includes quiz app, which will be used to check the aptitude and technical knowledge of candidate.
